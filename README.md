## Projects
1. CIFAR 10 classification
   * The task is to come up with a modified residual network (ResNet) architecture with the highest test accuracy on the given image classification dataset, under the constraint that your model has no more than 5 million parameters
   * `project1` directory contains the code for this project.

2. Finetuning with LoRA
   *  The task is to build a text classification model fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to categorize news articles into one of four categories: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech.
   *  `project2` directory contains the code for this project.  

3. Jailbreaking Deep Models
   *  The task is to launch effective adversarial
attacks on production grade, publicly posted models, and degrade their performance.
   *  `project3` directory contains the code for this project.
